  <h1>Enrichment II ---- Red Panda</h1>

  <h2>1. Further Reacher & Redesign</h2>
    <p>After making two enrichment proposals last week, which are a proper physical environment structure and a set of adjustable bamboo holders for the red panda, I got the feedback from the experts which indicate that my enrichments are too fundamental and not creative enough. Some suggest that the moveable bamboo might be an interesting idea but it needs deeper development. I do love the idea of making a feeding enrichment for the red panda but I can't really come up with an idea from the old enrichment proposal, so I decided to give those up and start from scratch again.
</p>
    <p> According to Newberry 1995 Environmental Enrichment Review, the way we design our enrichment should be based on what human want from the animal, in this case, our focus for the enrichment for the red panda as an endangered species should be how it would help them be able to survive when they are released back into the wild. </p>

    <p>So I spent a huge amount of time watch documentation of red panda in different zoos and how they interact with the environment and the administer. I found some behavior red panda has that I wasn't expecting and I thought could be the starting point of my new proposal. Then I try to find documentation of red panda in the wild and try to find similar behavior so I can understand the meaning behind those behaviors and try to make enrichment to encourage the same behavior for the red panda in the zoo if that behavior is important for their survival in the wild. But I can't find much documentation of red panda in the wild so I have to be careful to see if there are Anthropomorphism in my judgment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="smalltitle">Play/Hunting Behavior</p>
        <p>I found this behavior with happens when this red panda tries to "play" with the orange. For red panda, the signature move for aggressive behavior is when they raise up their pows and put it next to their head to make them seems bigger.</p>
