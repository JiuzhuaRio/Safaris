  <h1>Final Prototype----First Prototype</h1>

  <h2>First Design Proposal</h2>
  <p>The third idea will be the continue development of our midterm project which is the Curious Box. The first field test is not that success. We were trying to get away from making the project a feeding machine but the food turned out to be essential. And also the shape we choose and the target birds we chose are not very ideal. So I want to keep developing this idea but focus on birds in the shelter or home-raised and will make feeding part of the motivation.</p>
  <p>The Shape: The shape we used to use is a standard cube shape. We thought we chose a normal shape that won’t cause much attention but after rethinking about it is actually anthropomorphism cause although cube is a normal shape for human for birds it is quite weird and should be alarmed. I think this time I will use shape like column that are less interrogating for birds.</p>
  <p>The Mechanism: Cause this is still a curious box, so randomness will still be a big part of it. I will make several parts that could be interactive, but the result will be different. And some of the result will be feeding, which will be the motivation for the birds to keep engaging with the device. The reason of doing this is make this less a training process but a way to see the bird trying to figure out the inner mechanism of the device. And after the bird is fully engage with the device, I’ll make it impossible for the feeding result in occur and see how long the bird will keep engage or how they will engage.</p>

  <h2>Second Design</h2>
  <p>I redesigned the structure so it is a bit simpler to make. A random number generator is in the program and each time you have to pull the right rope to open the food box. </p>
