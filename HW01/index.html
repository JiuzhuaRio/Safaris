  <h1>Title of this responce</h1>
  <h3>Yufei Zhang</h3>
  <p>A new day has come, after I kept pressing a number of mobile phone alarms set in advance, I finally got up from the bed. Under the influence of this semester’s heavy academics, I no longer have the habit of viewing social media before getting up. I dressed up and went to the subway station. The subway station’s screen shows the shift information and arrival time automatically generated by the subway system. Everyone around them looked down at the phone with the morning exhaustion, browsing the information that was calculated by the big data algorithm and pushed in conjunction with the user’s characteristics. I feel that the flow of information is like a subway. It has a huge flow and is accurate for everyone, providing everyone with what they need. It may not be accurate, but everyone can choose the one that is most needed according to their demands.</p>
